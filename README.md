# My Little Terrorist

My Little Terrorist is a terrorist-cell simulation game where you receive requests from common sponsors of terrorism to perform destructive, and occasionally suicidal, acts of murder. To fulfill these requests you must gather recruits and bomb-making ingredients and manage them effectively.

This was an entry to the Ludum Dare 25 Jam, a 72-hour long game development competition. My Little Terrorist was a team effort. You can follow us all on twitter:
